# CS3316-Reinforcement-Learning

This is my repo for the course CS3316 Reinforcement Learning of SJTU. 

The algorithms of each assignment are listed below:

- A1: Dynamic Programming
- A2: Monte-Carlo and Temporal Difference
- A3: Sarsa and Q-learning
- A4: Deep Q-learning
- A5: A3C and DDPG

- Project: DDPG and DDQN



Honor Code: if you are a student in this course, you are required to finish these algorithms by yourself. The author is not responsible if you copy these codes.
